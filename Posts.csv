"2268959","1","","","2010-02-15 21:14:39","","1","143","<p>The DBA displays a lot of info in his stored proc as it executes.</p>

<p>From a Visual Studio 2003 CSharp Windows Form, 
when you launch a SQL Server 2000 stored procedure that returns records as well as an OUTPUT param,
is it possible to display the same verbose output as you would see in the Query Analyzer tool?</p>

<p>This is on top of showing the returned data in the datagrid.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Bert</p>

<p>Note that it will not work when <code>user_id</code> is a <code>NULL</code> (it will return <code>NULL</code> as well), but since your question only mentions zeros and positive integers, I post this without <code>NULL</code> checking.</p>

"2268965","2","","2268149","2010-02-15 21:15:50","","11","","<p>Let's look at what the C99 standard has to say about it:</p>

<p>See 7.1.3, ยง1, clause 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each identifier with file scope listed in any of the following subclauses [...] is <strong>reserved for use as a macro name</strong> and as an identifier with file scope in the same name space <strong>if any of its associated headers is included</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you include <code>stdlib.h</code>, the name <code>malloc</code> is reserved for use as a macro name.</p>

<p>But 7.1.4, ยง1 allows using <code>#undef</code> on reserved names:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of <code>#undef</code> to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an
  actual function is referred to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes it possible to re-<code>#define</code> <code>malloc</code>, which results in undefined behaviour according to  7.1.3, ยง2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the program [...] defines a reserved identifier as a macro name, <strong>the behavior is undefined</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the standard make this restriction? Because other functions of the standard library may be implemented as function-like macros in terms of the original function, so hiding the declaration might break these other functions.</p>

<p>In practice, you should be fine as long as your definition of <code>malloc</code> satisfies all provisions the standard provides for the library function, which can be achieved by wrapping an actual call to <code>malloc()</code>.</p>

It's still my preference compared to a trigger, because it's the most likely place to check.  A trigger means you now have two places to check when errors/issues occur.</p>

<p>Beyond that, it depends on the usage - in the foreseeable future, could there be records that should not be affected by the trigger logic?  If not, a trigger is a more centralized means of solving the issue.</p>
